### Coder Ipsum

Was created as 4th and final project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program. Coder Ipsum is a custom Lorem Ipsum creator. We were free to choose any technology and topic in this project, and I decided to challenge myself and work with React. At the time, React was a strange and foreign beast to me, but I felt that it was extremely cool and where the future is. And so I spent an entire week teaching myself the new way.

Coder Ipsum is silly and funny and I thought it was a cool thing to do. Plus it does have a useful application.

I'd say it paid off, as now I love React and work with it all the time.
