**Coder_Ipsum**

Project 4 for General Assembly Web Development Immersive.

Coder Ipsum is a custom Lorem Ipsum creator. It is developer themed, as you might imagine. Built in ReactJS, there is not much to it. It's silly and funny and I thought it was a cool thing to do. Plus it does have a useful application.

The biggest challenge for me was probably to start thinking in React mode. Divide app in components that can be repeated, separating more things out, and then passing data around correctly. It was quite a challenge to get used to React and how it looks, but it was fun and I loved it in the end.
